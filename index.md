# Git branch design lesson

> *Git can do everything but what is a good idea to do and what are bad ideas?*

Many good tutorials exist that explain what is possible with Git. This lesson
does not focus on what is possible with branches, but rather what strategies
are advisable to simplify collaboration and code maintenance.


## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of Git.
2. We build on top of [Introduction to version control with Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).
